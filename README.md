SO THIS IS THE GITHUB REPO OF MY SOC2025 TRADEBOTX
IT CONTAINS WEEK BY WEEK COVERAGE OF THINGS THAT I HAVE LEARNT

WEEK1:-
I STARTED LEARNING PYTHON BASICS FROM YOUTUBE VIDEOS PROVIDED AND LEARNED BASICS OF FINANCE THROUGH RESOURCES PROVIDED AND USED SCREENER TO GET SOME DATAS FROM ACTUAL STOCK MARKET INDEX(NIFTY).THEN NEXT UP LEARNED OOP USING THE MICROGRAD VIDEO OF ANDREJ KARPATHY, THE MICROGRAD I WROTE WHILE LEARNING IT IS IN THE REPO.

WEEK2:- 
THIS WEEK WAS A BIT MORE THEORY WITH MOST OF TIME JUST READING ABOUT TECHNICAL INDICATORS AND READING ABOUT VARIOUS STRATEGIES WHICH ARE POSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT

WEEK3:-
THIS WEEK GOT THE BACKTESTER SET UP(ALSO IN THE REPO) AND TRIED WRITING FEW BASIC STRATEGIES FOR THE ONE PRODUCT WHICH WAS PRESENT. THE PRODUCT SHOWED LESS VOLATILITY AND NEAR CONSTANT PRICE SO MUCH OF THE STRATEGIES WERE OF MARKET MAKING KIND. TRIED SOME OTHER TOO BUT THE PROFIT COULDNT BE REPLICATED.SOME STRATEGIES THAT I TRIED ARE IN THE REPO WITH COMMENTS ABOUT THEM

WEEK4:-
JUST STARTED WEEK 4 WITH TWO MORE PRODUCTS STILL ONLY TRYING TO IMPLEMENT SOME BASIC STRATEGIES,WOULD BE DOING PAIRS AND OPTIONS TRADING IN THIS WEEK WHEN THE RESOURCES ARE RELEASED. AND NOW I WILL BE DOING MAJOR WORK ON ABRA AND DROWZEE DUE TO A BIT OF BACKLOG

AFTER THIS JUST TRIED OUT SOME STRATEGIES OF PAIR TRADING AND OPTIMIZING THE STRATEGIES
THE FINAL STRATEGY IS IN THE CODE STRATEGY
HOPEFULLY YOU GIVE ME THE CERTIFICATE
